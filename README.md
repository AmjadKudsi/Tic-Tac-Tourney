# Tic-Tac-Tourney
Tic-Tac-Toe game logic with Random, Minimax, and Heuristic AI agents competing against a human player in a round-robin tournament. Explore agent dynamics and performance in matches against human opponent.

## Overview:

The project aims to design and implement AI agents using Minimax, Minimax with Alpha-beta pruning, and Expectimax algorithms to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. These agents will compete against a human player, with the game logic relying on heuristic functions, random agents, and efficient algorithms. A tournament framework will orchestrate matchups between agents, tracking performance metrics such as execution time and the number of nodes explored. The deliverables include implementing game logic, AI agents, and the tournament framework, with evaluation focusing on flawless execution and tournament dominance based on win rates and performance metrics.
